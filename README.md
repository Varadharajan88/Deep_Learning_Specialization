# Deep Learning Specialization Notes & Projects

This repository contains my notes, projects, and resources while completing the DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization courses.

## Courses Overview

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** - Fundamentals of neural networks, backpropagation, and deep learning
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks** - Hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects** - ML strategy, error analysis, and project management
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks** - CNNs, object detection, and face recognition
5. **Sequence Models** - RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and attention mechanisms

## Repository Structure

- `NOTES/`: Module-wise course notes, summaries, and exercises
  - Each course has its own folder with:
    - `notes.md`: Detailed lecture notes
    - `summary.md`: Key concepts and takeaways
    - `exercises.md`: Exercise solutions and practice problems
- `PROJECTS/`: Hands-on projects and assignments from the courses
- `RESOURCES/`: Supplementary materials (papers, datasets, external tutorials)
- `Lecture Videos/`: Course lecture videos (tracked with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large files)

## Lecture Videos

Lecture videos are stored in `Lecture Videos/` and tracked with **Git LFS**. After cloning, run `git lfs pull` to download the video files. If you don't need the videos, you can skip LFS pull.

## How I Use This Repo

1. Take detailed notes during lectures in `NOTES/<course>/notes.md`
2. Write up summaries (key concepts, formulas) in `summary.md`
3. Solve exercises and practice problems in `exercises.md`
4. For projects, include notebooks, data, and instructions in `PROJECTS/`

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Deep_Learning_Specialization
# If you want lecture videos (requires Git LFS):
git lfs install   # one-time per machine
git lfs pull      # download LFS-tracked files
```
